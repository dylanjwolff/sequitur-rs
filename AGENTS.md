## Project Rules

1. All documentation goes in README.md or as doc-comments in the code itself
2. All tests should be unit tests, property based tests, or fuzz tests in the code itself -- no ad-hoc files or bash scripts
3. Always run `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy` and `cargo test` after making large changes
